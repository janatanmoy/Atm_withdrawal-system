Title: Implementing Programs using State, While, For, Break, Continue, and Pass.
Program : Design and Implementation of an ATM Withdrawal System.
Algorithm:
1.	Start
2.	Initialize balance = 5000 (initial account balance).
3.	Set withdrawal_limit = 3 (maximum withdrawal attempts allowed).
4.	Initialize attempts = 0.
5.	Display "Welcome to the ATM!".
6.	Repeat Until User Exits or Withdrawal Limit is Reached:
a. Display current balance.
b. Prompt the user to enter the withdrawal amount (or 0 to exit).
c. If the entered amount is 0: 
o	Display "Exiting... Thank you for using the ATM!"
o	Stop the transaction.
            d. If the entered amount is greater than the balance:
o	Display "Insufficient balance! Try again."
o	Skip to the next iteration.
e. If the amount is not a multiple of 100:
o	Display "Please enter amount in multiples of 100."
o	Skip to the next iteration.
f. Deduct the withdrawal amount from balance.
g. Increment attempts by 1.
h. Display "Withdrawal successful! ₹[amount] dispensed."
i. If attempts reaches withdrawal_limit:
o	Display "You have reached the daily withdrawal limit. Try again tomorrow."
o	Stop the transaction.
7.	Display "Transaction ended."
8.	End
Code:
balance = 5000  # Initial balance
withdrawal_limit = 3  # Max withdrawal attempts
attempts = 0  

print("Welcome to the ATM!\n")

while True:
    print(f"Current Balance: ₹{balance}")
